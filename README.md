# Single-Cell-Analysis-Demo-Using-Scanpy
This is a demonstration of single cell analysis pipeline that I put together for a bio-python programming class. We had so much fun with this demo.
The data used here was collected using the Fluidigm platform with 1200 mesodermal cells sequenced , processed and filtered.
The purpose of the demo was to illustrate how you can use unsupervised clustering to identify different subpopulations of cells within a heterogenous cell population
The pipeline I chose for this demo was Scanpy. Since this was a Python class I decided that it was appropriate to use a pipeline that was implemented in Python. Hence the Scanpy Choice

The jupyter notebook called Analysis.ipynb (inventive huh? hahaha) contains the demo, codes with all the annotations to make the presentation understandable. I think?
